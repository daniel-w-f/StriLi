# StriLi

## Info
This Addon was developed for WoW version 3.3.5a WotLK. No guarantee that it will work with other versions.

## How to Install
Download the latest releases. Unzip the folder to your WoW Addons folder. Eg.:

    C:\Users\USERNAME\..\WoW\Interface\AddOns\
    
Make sure that the folder name of the unzipped folder is StriLi, otherwise the addon cannot be loaded. So the final path should look like: 
    
    C:\Users\USERNAME\..\WoW\Interface\AddOns\StriLi

And **NOT** like:

    C:\Users\USERNAME\..\WoW\Interface\AddOns\StriLi-1.0.2
